#Twabler for labeling Twitter Data
This project is a part of the Data Science Working Group at Code for San Francisco. It was initiated in order to provide all Code for America brigades with a tool for labeling Twitter data for NLP, with a longer term goal of generalizing for any data type. Other DSWG projects can be found at the main GitHub repo.

Please check out the [wiki](https://github.com/sfbrigade/twabler/wiki) where more detailed information will be added in the coming weeks.
